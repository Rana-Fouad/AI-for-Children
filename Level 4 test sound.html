        var initialText = "Welcome! You have made it to planet WanderWood! In this mysterious world, secrets hide among the trees, waiting to be uncovered. Here, you will explore, discover, and learn how AI finds hidden connections all on its own, with unsupervised machine learning! The journey continues, lets dive in!";
        var secondText = "Recall from level 3, unsupervised learning is like the computer being a detective! It gets a bunch of information with no answers and has to find patterns. For example, if you give it pictures of animals, it might group the cats and dogs together by what they look like.";
        var thirdText = "Imagine you are sorting jelly beans. Let us say you have a big pile of jelly beans, but you do not know their flavors. They come in many colors, and there is no one to tell you which color belongs to which flavor. Now, imagine you want to organize them somehow. This is where unsupervised learning comes in!";
        var fourthText = "In unsupervised machine learning, computers do the same thing, they are given a lot of information (or data), but they do not have any labels or instructions about what it all means. Their job is to look for patterns and try to make sense of the information on their own.";
        var fifthText = "How Does It Work? Just like you might start grouping your jelly beans by color (because that is a visible pattern), a computer tries to group information that looks similar or has something in common. This process of finding groups is called clustering.";
        var sixthText = "Now imagine you have grouped your jelly beans by color. You might have a red pile, a green pile, a yellow pile, and so on. But wait! What if some jelly beans look like they are in between two colors? For example, a jelly bean might be orange, but it looks a little reddish too. Where would you put it?";
        var seventhText = "Computers, look at all the details, such as the exact shade of color, size, or even shape, to decide where a jelly bean belongs. Sometimes, they might decide that orange jelly beans should go in a completely new group, or they might say they are close enough to the red group.";
        var eighthText = "Clustering works by finding these groups or 'clusters' without telling the computer what the groups should be. The computer looks for patterns in the data and tries to organize it as best as it can. It’s like the computer saying, ‘Hey, I think these things look alike, so I will put them together.";
        var ninthText = "Why Is Clustering Useful? Let’s say you don’t know what flavor each jelly bean is, but after grouping them by color, you decide to taste one from each pile. You notice all the red ones are strawberry, the green ones are lime, and the yellow ones are lemon.";
        var tenthText = "Even though no one told you, you figured it out by organizing the jelly beans first. That’s how clustering can help us find hidden patterns and make sense of things.";
        var eleventhText = "Clustering isn’t just for jelly beans! Scientists use clustering to group animals based on their features, like size and habitat. Doctors use it to find patterns in medical data to understand diseases. Even in your music app, clustering helps group songs into playlists that match your taste!";
        var twelvthText = "Now, let’s look at how we can group the animals. Your task is to sort them by their type, which means putting animals that are the same kind together. For example, all the dogs in one group, all the cats in another, and so on. Let’s get started!";
